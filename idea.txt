I have one idea . I think to build a website where many people regardless of knowledge,thoughts,color what ever may be can post their projects,plans,ideas and innovation on one website where people across the world can See it also they can send request to the responsible publisher who post the idea to access or use for their own project but with collabrative address.so here the publisher can also get benifit who initiate it first and so. It similar to github but in github we only take code from other people but here we can access or post many ideas,projects,plans,codes,thoughts,initiative startups etc., IS IT SUIT FOR THE 17TH GOAL THAT IS PARTNERSHIP ON GOALS???
